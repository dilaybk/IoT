## Adafruit IO - Budget Philips Hue
How I made a cheap version of Philips Hue

What you need:
  - Arduino NodeMCU
  - Led strip
  - Cable to connect to your pc

## Step 1: Installing Arduino IO
I installed Arduino IO by going to 'library manager' on the Arduino Software. 
I struggled a little by finding the proper library because the picture in the document that I followed showed something different than what I actually needed to install.

^This is the right one

I clicked on install as instructed and waited until it was done.

##Step 2: Adafruit IO Setup
Once all of that was downloaded I went to https://io.adafruit.com/ and made a free account. After that, there should be a yellow round icon with a key in it. Click on it.
There should be a pop-up with your username and active key. Copy each.

##Step 3: Colorpicker
On the Adafruit IO website, I went to Dashboards > New dashboard.
I made a new dashboard and called it ToDo2. 
In this dashboard I created a New Block by clicking the gear icon in the right corner and chose 'color picker'.

I set the feed name to 'color' and accept

Then you can manipulate the color within the circle
