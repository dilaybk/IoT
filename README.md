## Adafruit IO - Budget Philips Hue
How I made a cheap version of Philips Hue

What you need:
  - Arduino NodeMCU
  - Led strip
  - Cable to connect to your pc

## Step 1: Installing Arduino IO
I installed Arduino IO by going to 'library manager' on the Arduino Software. 
I struggled a little by finding the proper library because the picture in the document that I followed showed something different than what I actually needed to install.
